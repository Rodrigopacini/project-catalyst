- Submitted qualitative rationales to support each score
- Helped voters evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of proposals

### 🧠 Veteran Reviewer (Level 2)

- Co-developed the **“Red and Yellow Card Thing”** — a community standard for flagging low-effort or abusive reviews
- Supported review integrity and reviewer accountability

<summary>📈 Milestone Review Process (click to expand)</summary>

**Milestone Reviewer** since Fund 11:

- Reviewed **30+ funded projects**
- Validated **100+ Statements of Milestones (SoMs)** and **Proofs of Achievement (PoAs)**

### Statement of Milestones (SoM)
Each funded project is required to submit a SoM outlining key deliverables, acceptance criteria, and timelines. These serve as contractual checkpoints for funding disbursement.

### Proof of Achievement (PoA)
Funded projects must submit PoAs for each milestone, containing tangible evidence of completion:
- Documentation, deliverables, KPIs, or video walkthroughs
- Reviewed by two independent Milestone Reviewers
- Funding is released only if PoA meets the expectations set in the SoM

Rodrigo’s reviews play a direct role in enabling or blocking second/third-stage disbursements, supporting Cardano’s principle of **accountable treasury spending**.
